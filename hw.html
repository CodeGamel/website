    <h2>Step 1: Collecting your ingredients!</h2>
    <h4>You will need the following:</h4>
    <!-- After linking an image with two headers with different sizes, I did a bullet list for each step -->
    <ul>
        <li>Bread, any type! As long as its bread you and make this!</li>
        <br>
        <li>Peanut Butter, we highly recommend <mark>Jif Creamy Peanut Butter</mark></li>
        <br>
        <li>Jelly, we also highly recommend using a <mark>Jam</mark> for more experienced PB&J connoisseurs</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- A header for step 2 followed about the same formula for Step 1 down to line 55 -->
    <h2>Step 2: Placing the Peanut Butter!</h2>
    <h4>There is a special technique to this:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> Ensure you have a secure hand on the butter knife, make sure you stand shoulder-width to enure more stability.</li>
        <br>
        <li>With your main index finger on top of the knife, make sure you scoop some peanut butter on that bad boy.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Smear the <mark>peanut butter</mark> <b>delicately</b> on one side of your bread, leave the other side for step 3!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 3: Placing the Jelly!</h2>
    <h4>Keep the technique!</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> Just as the step before, assuming you have the proper standing position. Scoop the jelly onto the knife!</li>
        <br>
        <li>Smear the <mark>jelly</mark> <b>delicately</b> on the other side of your bread.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Step 4: Put it all together!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Now that you got both pieces of your bread perfectly crafted, just put one on top of the other</li>
        <br> <br>                                
        <li><b>Be careful not to drop the bread as you may have to go back to Step 1</b></li>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 5: <b>ENJOY!</b></h2>
